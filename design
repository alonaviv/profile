Marking time:
Classes:
Needs to have a year, given automatically when the class is created. Each start of a new year, automatically all classes won't appear anywhere. No need to see them anymore - only the evaluations are important now. 

Students + teachers - always there. Need to deal with deletion later. 

Evaluations:
Need a year in the same way. 
Need a trimester. Given upon creation of the evaluations automatically, based on a config file that determines when the
trimesters start and end.

Needs to match the year of the class, but I don't think this is a problem. The evaluations always match existing
classes and students as they are created automatically. When populating evaluations, always use classes from the current
year, and pass that year to the created evaluation.

When writing and reading evaluations, only the evaluations of the current trimester and year should appear.
