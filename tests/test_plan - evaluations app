Testing evaluations app:

Things that can be deleted: Class, Student, TeacherUser, removing student from class, removing student from homeroom

Rules I'd like to enforce. Enforce later - now test using this as a given:
* TeacherUser can't be deleted if he is teaching active classes or has kids in homeroom. When you delete a teacheruser,
you also add is_deleted to its teacher object.
* Need to have a process at the start of the year that removes all homerooms (can do so later - also, do we want to
save a record of the homerooms between years?).
* Class can't be deleted if it has students in it. Classes of a year that passed don't get deleted,
it just has a previous year. The only reason that a class can get deleted is if a teacher changes his mind in the middle
of that year. But the evaluations will still stay there.
* Student can get deleted at any time. He won't show up anywhere. But his evaluations will stay.

General situations I need to test regarding deletion:
============
Deleting Student:
* Have student get evaluation while in class and homeroom, then delete student -> Can still access evaluation and
doesn't appear in homeroom or in class and can't read or write his evaluation.
class anymore.
* Have student get evaluation, then leave class, then delete student -> Can still access evaluation - doesn't appear
in homeroom and can't read his evaluation.
* Have student in class along with another. Delete student. Move to next trimester -> No evaluation object for student
that trimester, but other student does have.
* Have a few deleted students that were previously in class (no written evals) and homeroom. See that they don't show up
 in:
- View evaluations to write for class
- View homeroom
- View students in class
- Add students to new class
- Add students to homeroom
- Write evals of class
- Dashboard - number of evals to write
- Dashboard - number of students you teach
- Dashboard - number of students in homeroom
- Status email - Number of stuff left to write, number of students in homeroom

Bad Urls:
* Go to page of view student evals of deleted student - See helpful error
* Go to page of delete student from class - student is in class, but deleted

=================

Removing student from class:
* Remove from class > Can still write evaluation.
* Write evaluation, remove from class, return to class -> Can see evaluation as usual in read and write.
* Remove from class, write evaluation, decide to delete evaluation -> Can't do it. Can still see it in read and write.
* Remove from class, decide to delete evaluation -> Can't see it in read and write.
* Remove from class, write evaluation, move to next trimester -> Can access old evaluation, can't read or write for current trimester
* Remove from class, decide to delete evaluation, return to class -> Can see in read and write that needs to write evaluation.

===============

Deleting Class:
( I changed this - you now can't delete a class that has written evals for this trimester. Need to change test plan)
* Have class. Write a few evals and leave some empty. Remove those students, delete class. Send status email. -> see
that you can still view evals in this trimester, Class doesn't appear in list of classes to write evals for,
Class doesn't appear in list of classes to manage, Class doesn't appear in class list for student, evals don't appear in
 dashboard. Evals don't appear in email.
* Try to remove class with students through url -> fail
* Have class, write a few evals and leave some empty. Remove students and delete class. Move to next trimester, but same
 year -> See that class doesn't appear in class for teacher. No evals created. Can access old evals.
* Have class with some evals and leave some empty. Move to next year -> Class doesn't appear anywhere. Can access old
evals.
* Have class with a few evals and leave some empty. Delete class, try to add a new class with the same name -> Should
let you to do so (in order to allow teachers to delete and then recreate), but the evaluations stay, under a deleted
class with a different id.
* Have class with completed and incompleted evals. Delete class. Read UserTeacher.completed_evals_in_current_trimester
and UserTeacher.all_evals_in_current_trimester. These numbers should include the evals that were already written,
but not the evals that were empty when the class was deleted.


Bad urls:
* Go to write class evaluations of deleted class
* Go to delete student from class of deleted class
* Go to add students to class of deleted class

======
Deleting TeacherUser:
* Add class with students to teacher, and have homeroom. Write some evals, leave others empty. Remove students
from class and delete class. Remove students from homeroom. Delete user+teacher. -> See that can access evals. See
that his students don't have homeroom teacher and that he is not required to create a new user.
* Delete TeacherUser, try to register new user with that name and email. -> I think shouldn't work
* Delete TeacherUser, try to register new user with that name and different email -> I think shouldn't work
* Delete TeacherUser, try to register new user with different name and same email -> should work


DB deletion settings validations:
* Delete teacher object when user exists - Fail
* Delete user object when teacher exists - Succeed
* Delete user that has student -> fail
* Delete user that has class -> fail
* Delete student that has a class -> fail

* Delete house that has student -> fail
* Delete house that has a teacher -> fail
* Delete house that has a class -> fail
* Delete Class that has students -> I think will succeed, protected by view.
* Delete student that has eval -> fail
* Delete class that has eval -> fail
* Delete evaluation with class and student -> Succeed
* Delete class without students -> Succeed
* Delete student with house and homeroom teacher but no classes -> succeed
* Delete subject without a class -> Succeed
* Delete teacher object that doesn't have a user -> succeed
* Delete house that doesn't have a teacher or a class or a student -> succeed

========

I added the ability to create several classes of the same name, if each class has a different teacher.
And then if a teacher deletes a class and then recreates it, they will receive the same class object.
