* Trimester should be a kind of environment variable. Think about it - maybe the admin "opens up" the website
for evaluations period for that semester, and then everything is according to that semester. For writes, you can only
write into that semester. For reads, maybe it shows the default of that semester, but have links to previous semesters
(and years), if these exist.
* Along with semester, I think we should add year. Need to think how to define the hebrew school year. Same thing - add it staticlly for now just so it's in the db. Next time around, your'll use that and change the variable. Need to think how to mark classes per year as well. This gets tricky.
* Think about the fact that teachers can stop being chonchim next year and other changes that could happen between years.
* Save evaluations that were actually deleted.


* "Forgot password" mechanism - also, double checking password seems important here.

* Format the forms. In the write review form for a class, show on the top again how many you wrote. 
Also, have a sign of green or red next to each review, to see if it was submitted successfully. Tricky work with the form formatting. Do the same with adding students to classes.

* A system to show everyone what is missing - maybe on the home page?
Show on the home page a status maybe, how many classes you added, with how many kids total.
How many reviews total you have left to write.
And on the side of the homeroom teacher, How many are missing, and from how many teachers (showing the number missing from each teacher)
Also have a section to show how many students they have in the homeroom, how many classes they have, and how many students total do they teach. Link to edit classes/homeroom.

* See if you should pay for backups on digital ocean.



======================
The only thing that the school itself needs to do is to give me a list of students (first name, last name and house), teachers (first name and last name)
and subject (just name - but remember to add אחר)
I can write a basic script that reads csv/excel and puts each line into the model.

================

* Have a running task that all kids have a homeroom teacher. If they don't, maybe send an email to Dalit or me. 

* I think we should maybe define two stages - first all teachers have to create their classes and home rooms. Then I should run verifications on the database. The divuchim adding part can be orthoganal. The main thing to check is that all kids have a homeroom teacher that can track them. 

===========
Stupid things teachers might do and I should validate.

* Not have any classes
* Not be added at all to the database. Need to check the teacher users against a static list of their names I think. Maybe go back and decide that the teachers should actually be static - only then someone else could somehow take their spot? I actually think that's better - have a new user associated with the teacher, and then only those teachers can register, and we can validate that all teachers have a user defined. 
* Not add any kids to homerooms - the validation of kids in homeroom will find that.
* Not add all the kids to their classes - nothing to do about that, but we should make sure that their classes all have at least one kid (or maybe more?)
* Think about the issue of the fact that evaluations are deleted when a kid is removed from a class. Is this OK?

I think I should implement all these things as clean methods for the models - and then have something that runs clean on all of them. clean should maybe just return a boolean. Or maybe a different name, so I can use clean for models that should never be created that way. Maybe use validate() 

======================
Additions later on:
* Filter forms by letters maybe?
* Search for a kid's name, don't just select all from a form.
use javascript to make all of this responsive.
* Add subjects that teachers in general teach to their user (can be several or none), Use that for default for all their classes when they add in a new class.
* Pagination everywhere
* Request email and password twice in register form
* Use django authentication backend instead of creating a needless username from first+last name
