Important before opening:
1. Fix whole deletion thing (Think about the issue of the fact that evaluations are deleted when a kid is removed from
 a class, did I take care of this?)
2. Sending emails to everyone periodically function - tell then their basic status.
3. Have a running task about the following things. If they don't, maybe send an
email to Dalit or me. I think best to have 2 emails, one for information and one for warning when something changes to
bad. For now, have these as cli tasks that I manually produce (same with emails to everyone)
Add some managing field to some of the users (not superuser, don't mess with that), and a page with the results of
the check that only they can access, along with sending the emails. Later you can cron it.
    List of checks:
    * All students have homeroom - included in warning if changes.
    * Teachers that haven't signed up yey - only info
    * Number of students that don't have classes - only info, and only the numbers I think. Ask if this should be send to
    them or not.
    * Classes with only one kid - only info. Ask if I should send this, and what the minimal number of students for this
    should be
4. Email validation before signing in: https://studygyaan.com/django/how-to-signup-user-and-send-confirmation-email-in-django
5. When doing cronjob, do cron job for running ./manage dbbackup, and delete old ones. Maybe each time you take one you
delete the latest, only if the backup folder reached a certain number of backups or certain size.
(Check out django-cronjobs and django-crontab for this)


- Nice to have:

* Emails in RTL on gmail somehow
* Make nice HTML emails
â€¢ Multiple chonchim/multiple teachers?
* Downloadable PDF

===========

* Work on all forms of deletion:
 - Think about the fact that teachers can stop being chonchim next year and other changes that could happen between years.
 - Save evaluations that were actually deleted. Focuse on the automatic deletion of evaluations when student leaves a class/class is deleted. Not sure we ever want to delete an evaluation, we'll see. And if we do, make sure that we don't delete evaluations from previous semesters.
 - Need to change alert message when deleting student?


* See if possible to add sex to students as well, for text

* Bug - seems can't add evaluations of same trimester and different years


Important for the future, not the first one:
* When in NULL-SEMESTER, don't allow to fill out any evals, and display in the square that there are no more meetings
this year. Also make sure that nothing can get a null semester value.
* Add viewing of previous evalutions - both written by and previous for that student read (and also for all the years?
Ask them if that is OK)



======================
Additions later on:
* Filter forms by letters maybe?
* Search for a kid's name, don't just select all from a form.
use javascript to make all of this responsive.
* Add subjects that teachers in general teach to their user (can be several or none), Use that for default for all their classes when they add in a new class.
* Pagination everywhere
* Use django authentication backend instead of creating a needless username from first+last name
* Ability to upload files with the evaluations
* Cute encoureging messages as they progress through it.
