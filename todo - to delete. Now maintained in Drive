Rules to enforce when deleting teachers and students and classes (of course by delete I mean soft delete - add
is_deleted):
* TeacherUser can't be deleted if he is teaching active classes or has kids in homeroom. When you delete a teacheruser,
you also soft delete its teacher object.
* Class can't be deleted if it has students in it. Classes of a year that passed don't get deleted,
it just has a previous year. The only reason that a class can get deleted is if a teacher changes his mind in the middle
of that year. But the evaluations will still stay there. Currently this is enforced by frontend. Can't delete classes
with students.
* (Student can get deleted at any time. He won't show up anywhere. But his evaluations will stay.)
